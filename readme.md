I will never run out of ways to procrastinate my work and research.
Just try me.

Solutions will mostly be in Python, Haskell, Julia, or whatever I feel like; the solutions given may sacrifice efficiency for elegance or laziness.
Eventually, some problems *may* be updated with more optimal solutions.
